        <h2>What is Replate?</h2>
        <p> Replating is filling the plate with leftover food or unused food and redistribute it to local hungry populations via food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and afterschool programs.
            Replate collects information about volunteers and donors or business, forms a niche in which it can do the purpose of redistributing food in an efficient way to needy people. 
            Replate reduces wastage of food and makes a happy and green planet.

                <p>"It's now almost a year since I started working with the team, I can proudly say my life has never
                    been better! Serving hot and healthy breakfast to these less fortunate school children may seem like
                    an act of giving, but in reality I have received much more from them. The satisfaction I have
                    derived from their love and laughter is simply unparalleled." </p>
